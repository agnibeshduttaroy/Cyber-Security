		<b>Clickjacking</b>
	</h1>
	<p>
		<b>Clickjacking, also known as "UI redress attack" or "User Interface redress attack", is a 
malicious technique in which an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on 
another webpage while the user intended to click on the top level page.This is done using 
multiple transparent or opaque layers. The attacker is basically "hijacking" the clicks meant 
for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page, most likely owned by 
someone else. A similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes. Carefully drafting a 
combination of stylesheets, iframes, buttons and text boxes, a user can be led into believing 
that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic web page while it is 
being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker.</b>
