		<b>Phishing</b>
	</h1>
	<p>
		<b>Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information 
such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from 
users. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant 
messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake 
website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate 
one. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form 
of social engineering.</b>
