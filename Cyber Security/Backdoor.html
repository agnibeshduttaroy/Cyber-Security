	</h1>
	<p>
		<b>A Backdoor in a computer system, a crypto system or an algorithm, is any secret 
method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. Backdoors may exist for a number 
of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been 
added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious 
reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.</b>
