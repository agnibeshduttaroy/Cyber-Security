one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.There are several types of spoofing :</b>

	<ul>
		<li>Email spoofing, where an attacker forges the sending (From, or source) address of an email</li>
		<li>IP address spoofing, where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system</li>
		<li>MAC spoofing, where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control (MAC) address of their network interface to pose as a valid user on a network</li>
