	<h1>
		<b>Direct access Attack</b>
	</h1>
	<p>
		<b>An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to 
directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system 
modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using 
wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may 
be able to be by-passed by booting an other operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other 
bootable media. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these 
attacks.</b>
