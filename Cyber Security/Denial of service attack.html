		<b>Denial of service attack</b>
	</h1>
	<p>
		<b>Denial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource 
unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as 
by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims 
account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block 
all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a 
new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, 
where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult. 
Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet, but a range of other 
techniques are possible including reflection and amplification attacks, where innocent 
systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.
